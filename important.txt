 Linear Regression is used to handle regression problems whereas Logistic regression is used to handle the classification problems. Linear regression provides a continuous output but Logistic regression provides discreet output

 Numpy working for arrays

 Pandas working with datasets for analyzing cleaning exploring manipulating data


 Matplotlib is for graph plotting and as a visualization utility

 Seaborn is for making statistical graphics

 head shows top 5 results

 tail shows bottom 5 results

df.isnull().sum()  returns the number of missing values in the dataset

 dtypes for data type checking

 df.shape is for number of rows and columns in datasets

 df.describe contains description of data like count , min , max , standard deviation

 df.info() cotanins summary of data frame like number of rows and columns data types

 corr is for correlation of all coloumns

 Describe () min max count mean std

 Dropna() null values drop

 Confusion Matrix for analysing model performance like activation recall and f1sore

 Label encoder converts  categorical labels into numerical values for modelling

 iloc is a method for indexing data frame

 The slice [:, 1:5] selects all rows (denoted by :) and the columns from index 1 to 4 (exclusive), while [:, 5:] selects all rows and the column at index 5 to the end.

Gaussian Naive Bayes is a popular classification algorithm in machine learning, particularly known for its simplicity and efficiency.

 A confusion matrix shows the counts of predicted classes versus actual classes

 (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)  accuracy

 (FP + FN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN) error rate

 TP / (TP + FN) sensitivity recall and true positive rate

 TN / (FP + TN) specificity true negative rate


 FP / (FP + TN) false positive rate

 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) f1 score

 It seeks to model the distribution of inputs of a given class or category

 regression means that relates a dependent variable to one or more independent variable

 nltk natural language tollkit

 Tokenization splitting text into word or sentense

 Stopwords Removal - removing  common words like and is or

 Stemming - reducing the word running - run

 Lemmatization - reducing word considering part of speech eg better - good

 POS Tagging: identifying and labeling part of speech

 nltk library provides tools for text proessing

 puntk is tokennization model

 TfidfVectorizer converts text documents into a TF-IDF matrix, where each row represents a document, and each column represents a term

 F-IDF stands for "Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency,"

 Vectorization: Converts text documents into a numerical format (a matrix), where each row represents a document, and each column represents a term or word.

 histogram - distribution of continuous dataset , and each representing particular category

 boxplot - summerizing a set of data

 heatmap - popular data visualization technique that uses color to represent differnt level of data magnitude

countplot - shows the counts of observations in each categorical bin using bar

 scatter plot- denoted by dot .

 scatter plot- identifies a possible relationship between changes observed in two different sets of variables.
